          <p>I'm a former Army 'brat' with a passion for all things outdoors (including gardening, sculling, and hiking), watching cute animal videos and solving problems through code. My former life was as an affordable housing syndicator. Throughout my career, I had secretly dreamed of becoming a software developer.</p>

          <p>I have background in many different fields including science (tribology), teaching students, running my own business and even working night shifhts at the bread wrapping conveyor. The last 2 years I've been working as HR, QA Coordinator and then a Supervisor for a home care agency. But even though all these positions might seem to have nothing in common, they all are connected for me through my passion to tech as no matter what position I held besides my main duties I always ended up focusing on some tech-related tasks. So I realized that the time has come for me to stop beating around the bush and finally switch my career towards software development.</p>

          <p>I have been in the digital marketing space since 2014, doing analytics work across many different industries. Recently, after listening to a Microsoft event where AI was being used to do things that very closely matched my job description, I became convinced that it was time to make a change to being the guy who builds the thing that automates my job away, rather than being on the recieving end. I spend my free time trying to wrap my brain around the fundamental structure of programming, hanging out with friends and playing with my laser collection.</p>
